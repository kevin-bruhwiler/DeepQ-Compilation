# DeepQ-Compilation
A compilation of all my DeepQ python programs for OpenAI gym

All programs will be listed with the library that they were implemented with and a link to their performance on OpenAI Gym's website.

Wintermute is a neural network API that I've been building. I will upload it to GitHub when it's a little more complete and has been thoroughly tested.
